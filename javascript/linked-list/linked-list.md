# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
linked lists are a data structure that can be useful for adding or deleting elements and have some downsides as well.
bigO is between O(1) and O(n)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create a singly linked list has a method to insert, method to check and a method to list the nodes values. 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
while loop to traverse the linked list. as for why? because we dont know the length of the list.
big O of time is O(n);
big O of space is O(1);

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert(): inserts a node at the start of the linked list.
includes(): checks the linked list's nodes for a given value.
toString(): lists out all the node values as strings.
