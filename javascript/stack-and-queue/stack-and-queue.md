## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
validate brackets using a stack or a queue.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
enqueue and dequeue methods.
bigO(n) for the methods implemented so far.
## API

- push(): adds to the begining of the stack or the queue.
